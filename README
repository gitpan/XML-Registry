NAME
XML::Registry Version 0.02

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Larry Wall wrote the original XML::Parser which uses
James Clark's expat XML parser. Clark Cooper is the present
maintainer of the XML::Parser module, and has been a
great help.

DESCRIPTION
This is a simple little package I whipped up for an article
for TPJ. Its purpose is to experiment with converting Perl
data structures to XML and converting XML to perl data 
structures. 

The idea is to convert XML to Perl and back again using
a specific XML syntax; in this case, a kind of registry.

Feel free to contact me at eisen@pobox.com if you have 
problems and/or suggestions.
